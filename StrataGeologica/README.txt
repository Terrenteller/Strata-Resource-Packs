StrataGeologica is the "Stratification" of PFAA Geologica and contains most of the original blocks in some way, shape, or form. We rely on CustomOreGen to put our blocks into the world just as PFAA Geologica did. If you choose to use CustomOreGen and want these options, copy "./external/config/CustomOreGen/modules/custom/strata/redistribution/Geologica.xml" to "<game>/config/CustomOreGen/modules/custom/strata/redistribution/Geologica.xml". StrataCore is required if using CustomOreGen.
